# 🌱 YoGreen – Waste Management & Eco Point System

YoGreen is a Java-based desktop application developed using **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** principles.  
The application simulates a waste management system where users can submit waste pickup requests, earn eco points, redeem rewards, and interact with admins and officers through a role-based system.

This project was developed as a **Final Project for Object-Oriented Programming (PBO)** using **Java Swing**, **JDBC**, and **MySQL**.
